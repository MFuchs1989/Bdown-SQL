A topic which must not be missing in the course of SQL are Joins. 
In this article I will talk about the different types of joins and explain how they work and what differences they have to each other. 



# 2 Preparation

For the following examples, I set up a new database.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SET LANGUAGE ENGLISH


CREATE DATABASE Joins;

USE Joins;
```

Below I will create 4 example tables that we will continue to work with.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE Countries_Main
    (Country_ID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
     Country_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
    ;

INSERT INTO Countries_Main (Country_Name) VALUES ('Egypt')
INSERT INTO Countries_Main (Country_Name) VALUES ('Brazil')
INSERT INTO Countries_Main (Country_Name) VALUES ('Germany')
INSERT INTO Countries_Main (Country_Name) VALUES ('Malta')

SELECT * FROM Countries_Main
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE Countries_Capital
    (ID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
	 Country_ID INT NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Countries_Main(Country_ID),
     Capital_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
    ;

INSERT INTO Countries_Capital (Country_ID, Capital_Name) VALUES (1, 'Cairo')
INSERT INTO Countries_Capital (Country_ID, Capital_Name) VALUES (2, 'Brasilia')
INSERT INTO Countries_Capital (Country_ID, Capital_Name) VALUES (3, 'Berlin')
INSERT INTO Countries_Capital (Country_ID, Capital_Name) VALUES (4, 'Valletta')

SELECT * FROM Countries_Capital
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p2.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE Countries_Inhabitants
    (ID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
	 Country_ID INT NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Countries_Main(Country_ID),
     Inhabitants FLOAT NOT NULL)
    ;

INSERT INTO Countries_Inhabitants (Country_ID, Inhabitants) VALUES (1, 93.4)
INSERT INTO Countries_Inhabitants (Country_ID, Inhabitants) VALUES (2, 207.9)
INSERT INTO Countries_Inhabitants (Country_ID, Inhabitants) VALUES (4, 0.44)

SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p3.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE Countries_Land_Area
    (ID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
	 Country_ID INT NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Countries_Main(Country_ID),
     Land_Area FLOAT NOT NULL)
    ;

INSERT INTO Countries_Land_Area (Country_ID, Land_Area) VALUES (1, 1)
INSERT INTO Countries_Land_Area (Country_ID, Land_Area) VALUES (2, 8.5)
INSERT INTO Countries_Land_Area (Country_ID, Land_Area) VALUES (3, 0.36)

SELECT * FROM Countries_Land_Area
```

Here again briefly an overview of all 4 created tables:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Main
SELECT * FROM Countries_Capital
SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
SELECT * FROM Countries_Land_Area
```

# 3 Types of Joins

Below I will walk through the different types of joins and explain how they work using the sample tables I have created.
Furthermore I will always show at the beginning, with which tables exactly I will execute the following join.

## 3.1 Inner Join

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15s2.png)

Source: [C.L. Moffatt](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
SELECT * FROM Countries_Land_Area
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p6.png)

This join will return all of the records in the left table (Countries_Inhabitants [t1]) that have a matching record in the right table (Countries_Land_Area [t2]). 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID, 
	   t1.Inhabitants, 
	   t2.Land_Area
	FROM Countries_Inhabitants AS t1
	INNER JOIN Countries_Land_Area AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
	;
```

## 3.2 Left Join

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15s3.png)

Source: [C.L. Moffatt](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Main
SELECT * FROM Countries_Capital
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p8.png)

This join will return all of the records in the left table (Countries_Main [t1]) regardless if any of those records have a match in the right table (Countries_Capital [t2]).


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID,
	   t1.Country_Name,
	   t2.Capital_Name
	FROM Countries_Main AS t1
	LEFT JOIN Countries_Capital AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p9.png)


But what would happen if a value in the second (right) table is not available?
Have a look here:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Main
SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p10.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID,
	   t1.Country_Name,
	   t2.Inhabitants
	FROM Countries_Main AS t1
	LEFT JOIN Countries_Inhabitants AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p11.png)

The missing information is replaced with a NULL value.




## 3.3 Right Join

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15s4.png)

Source: [C.L. Moffatt](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Main
SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p12.png)

This join will return all of the records in the right table (Countries_Inhabitants [t2]) regardless if any of those records have a match in the left table (Countries_Main [t1]).


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID,
	   t1.Country_Name,
	   t2.Inhabitants
	FROM Countries_Main AS t1
	RIGHT JOIN Countries_Inhabitants AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p13.png)


You can also generate this output with a Left JOIN by swapping the two table specifications in the FROM statement and LEFT JOIN statement.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID,
	   t2.Country_Name,
	   t1.Inhabitants
	FROM Countries_Inhabitants AS t1
	LEFT JOIN Countries_Main AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p14.png)

For better readability I have adjusted the order of the returned columns. 

Here again for comparison the relevant section from the Left JOIN shown above.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
...
	FROM Countries_Main AS t1
	LEFT JOIN Countries_Inhabitants AS t2
...
```


## 3.4 Outer Join

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15s5.png)

Source: [C.L. Moffatt](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins)

As known as FULL OUTER JOIN or FULL JOIN.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
SELECT * FROM Countries_Land_Area
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p15.png)


This join will return all of the records from both tables, joining records from the left table (Countries_Inhabitants [t1]) that match records from the right table (Countries_Land_Area [t2]).


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t1,
	   t1.Inhabitants,
	   t2.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t2,
	   t2.Land_Area
	FROM Countries_Inhabitants AS t1
	FULL OUTER JOIN Countries_Land_Area AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p16.png)


Here again the output of the Inner JOIN for comparison:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID, 
	   t1.Inhabitants, 
	   t2.Land_Area
	FROM Countries_Inhabitants AS t1
	INNER JOIN Countries_Land_Area AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p17.png)


## 3.5 Left Excluding Join

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15s6.png)

Source: [C.L. Moffatt](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
SELECT * FROM Countries_Land_Area
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p18.png)


This query will return all of the records in the left table (Countries_Inhabitants [t1]) that do not match any records in the right table (Countries_Land_Area [t2]). 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t1,
	   t1.Inhabitants,
	   t2.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t2,
	   t2.Land_Area
	FROM Countries_Inhabitants AS t1
	LEFT JOIN Countries_Land_Area AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
		WHERE t2.Country_ID IS NULL
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p19.png)


## 3.6 Right Excluding Join

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15s6.png)

Source: [C.L. Moffatt](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
SELECT * FROM Countries_Land_Area
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p20.png)

This join will return all of the records in the right table (Countries_Land_Area [t2]) that do not match any records in the left table (Countries_Inhabitants [t1]). 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t1,
	   t1.Inhabitants,
	   t2.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t2,
	   t2.Land_Area
	FROM Countries_Inhabitants AS t1
	RIGHT JOIN Countries_Land_Area AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
		WHERE t1.Country_ID IS NULL
	;
```

## 3.7 Outer Excluding Join

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15s7.png)

Source: [C.L. Moffatt](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
SELECT * FROM Countries_Land_Area
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p22.png)


This join will return all of the records in the left table (Countries_Inhabitants [t1]) and all of the records in the right table (Countries_Land_Area [t2]) that do not match.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t1,
	   t1.Inhabitants,
	   t2.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t2,
	   t2.Land_Area
	FROM Countries_Inhabitants AS t1
	FULL OUTER JOIN Countries_Land_Area AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
		WHERE t1.Country_ID IS NULL OR t2.Country_ID IS NULL
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p23.png)


Here again for comparison the result of the Outer JOIN / Full Outer JOIN:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t1,
	   t1.Inhabitants,
	   t2.Country_ID AS Country_ID_t2,
	   t2.Land_Area
	FROM Countries_Inhabitants AS t1
	FULL OUTER JOIN Countries_Land_Area AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
	;
```

# 4 Multiple Joins

Of course, you also have the possibility to combine several joins with each other. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Countries_Main
SELECT * FROM Countries_Capital
SELECT * FROM Countries_Inhabitants
SELECT * FROM Countries_Land_Area
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p25.png)

In each of the tables the primary key ('Country_ID') from the main table 'Countries_Main' is stored as the foreing key. After that we join all tables together:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID,
	   t1.Country_Name,
	   t2.Capital_Name,
	   t3.Inhabitants,
	   t4.Land_Area
	FROM Countries_Main AS t1
	LEFT JOIN Countries_Capital AS t2
		ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
	LEFT JOIN Countries_Inhabitants AS t3
		ON t1.Country_ID = t3.Country_ID
	LEFT JOIN Countries_Land_Area AS t4
		ON t1.Country_ID = t4.Country_ID
	;
```

# 5 Join Tables from 2 different Databases

Furthermore, it is also possible to join different tables from 2 different databases.
Let's take another look at our main table in advance:

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p27.png)



Now I create another database called 'Joins2' and add another sample table ('Countries_Currency') there.
Note: A foreign key relationship between two databases is not possible with SQL Server. Therefore I will leave out this definition when defining the columns. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE DATABASE Joins2;

USE Joins2;
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p28.png)


Note: A foreign key relationship between two databases is not possible with SQL Server. Therefore I will leave out this definition when defining the columns.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE Countries_Currency
    (ID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
     Country_ID INT NOT NULL,
     Currency VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
    ;

INSERT INTO Countries_Currency (Country_ID, Currency) VALUES (1, 'Egyptian Pound')
INSERT INTO Countries_Currency (Country_ID, Currency) VALUES (2, 'Brazilian Real')
INSERT INTO Countries_Currency (Country_ID, Currency) VALUES (3, 'Euro')
INSERT INTO Countries_Currency (Country_ID, Currency) VALUES (4, 'Maltese Lira')

SELECT * FROM Countries_Currency
```

![](/post/2021-04-21-joins_files/p15p29.png)


The two tables ('Countries_Capital' & 'Countries_Currency') from the two databases ('Joins' & 'Joins2') can be joined together using the following syntax:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT table_1.*,
	   table_2.*
	FROM [Database_1].[Table_Schema].[Table_Name_1] table_1
	JOIN [Database_2].[Table_Schema].[Table_Name_2] table_2 
		ON table_1.id = table_2.id
	;
```

And here is the syntax applied to our present case:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT t1.Country_ID,
       t1.Country_Name,
       t2.Currency
    FROM [Joins].[dbo].[Countries_Main] AS t1
    LEFT JOIN [Joins2].[dbo].Countries_Currency AS t2
        ON t1.Country_ID = t2.Country_ID
    ;
```

# 6 Conclusion


In this post I have shown what different types of joins exist and how to use them.
