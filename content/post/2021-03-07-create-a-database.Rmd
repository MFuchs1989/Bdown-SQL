# 1 Introduction


Now that we have learned about the [different types of databases](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/01/types-of-databases/) and what an [entity-relationship diagram](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/03/entity-relationship-diagram-erd/) is, it is time to create the first SQL database. I use [Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) from Microsoft for this. 


# 2 Getting Started


First of all you need an on-premise SQL Server from Microsoft . You can download it here: 

+ [Free specialized edition: Developer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)


Next, please download SSMS:

+ [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)



After we have performed both installations and started SSMS the following window appears:

Select `Server type: 'Database Engine'` and the `default server name`. 



# 3 Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

First of all we need a New Query.
We can request these as follows:

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p2.png)

Since I would like to have the output of [SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) always in English I use the following syntax.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SET LANGUAGE ENGLISH
```



## 3.1 Create a new Database

To create a new database we need the following syntax:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE DATABASE MyDB;
```

This command can be executed as follows (mark the desired syntax):

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p3.png)

Now let's have a look at our Object Explorer on the left. 

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p4.png)

As we can see, the database has been created. 
But it is logically still completely empty. So we will first fill it with a table:



## 3.2 Create a new Table

If we want to create a new table in the created database, we must first tell the system which database I want to use: 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
USE MyDB;
```

Now we are ready to create a new table in the 'MyDB' database.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE Customer
	(ID INT NOT NULL,
	First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
	;
```

The table is named 'Customer' and consists of the following columns:

+ ID (which must **not be zero**)
+ First_Name (with a maximum number of **100 characters**; must also **not be zero**)
+ Last_Name (same defaults as for First_Name)

Of course you have the possibility to add a lot of [other columns with different data types](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp). 


Here we can see that the 'Customers' table has been created under the 'MyDB' database:

### 3.2.1 A glimpse at the new Table

To take a look at the table, a select statement can be executed:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Customer
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p6.png)


### 3.2.2 Inserting values into the Table

The next step is to fill the table with values. This is done using the insert command.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
INSERT INTO Customer (ID, First_Name, Last_Name) VALUES (1, 'Michael', 'Fuchs')
```


Let's take another look at the table:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Customer
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p7.png)

**Tip!** You can also write the INSERT command like this:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES (1, 'Michael', 'Fuchs')
```

The column names can, but do not have to, be named. 


## 3.2 Create a Database for Data Manipulation

Now I want to create another database with two tables, which I want to delete afterwards. 
Tip: Execute the command `USE DB_to_Delete` separately, otherwise the two tables will be written to the database 'MyDB'.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE DATABASE DB_to_Delete;


USE DB_to_Delete;


CREATE TABLE Table_1
	(ID INT NOT NULL,
	First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
	;

CREATE TABLE Table_2
	(ID INT NOT NULL,
	First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
	;
```


Here is the created database:

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p8.png)


And here are the tables created:

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p9.png)


Let's have a look at the tables again (they are displayed according to the order in which the commands are written, so Table_1 is shown at the top and Table_2 at the bottom). 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Table_1
SELECT * FROM Table_2
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p10.png)



### 3.2.1 Delete specific Columns 


The following command can be used to delete certain columns:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ALTER TABLE Table_1 DROP COLUMN ID;

ALTER TABLE Table_2 DROP COLUMN First_Name, Last_Name;
```


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Table_1
SELECT * FROM Table_2
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p11.png)

We can see that in Table_1 the column 'ID' is missing and in Table_2 the columns 'First_Name' and 'Last_Name'. 



### 3.2.2 Add new Columns

Just as we can delete columns, we can also add new columns to existing tables.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ALTER TABLE Table_1 ADD Further_Column VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p12.png)



### 3.2.3 Delete the table contents

Now the next step is to fill the modified table with new rows. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
INSERT INTO Table_1 (First_Name, Last_Name, Further_Column) VALUES ('Michael', 'Fuchs', 'some_text')
INSERT INTO Table_1 (First_Name, Last_Name, Further_Column) VALUES ('Alex', 'Smith', 'some_text')
INSERT INTO Table_1 (First_Name, Last_Name, Further_Column) VALUES ('John', 'Green', 'row_to_delete')
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Table_1
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p18.png)


#### 3.2.3.1 Delete specific rows

With the following command we have the possibility to delete certain rows from your table:



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
DELETE FROM Table_1
	WHERE Further_Column = 'row_to_delete'
	;
```

Let's take another look at the table:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Table_1
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p20.png)



#### 3.2.3.2 Delete the entire content


With the command TRUNCATE we can delete the contents of a table, but keep the table in and of itself. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
TRUNCATE TABLE Table_1;
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Table_1
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p19.png)



### 3.2.4 Delete the whole Table


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
DROP TABLE Table_2;
```


By executing the command shown above, we have deleted the entire table ('Table_2'). 

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p13.png)


### 3.2.5 Delete the whole Database

Like tables, entire databases can be deleted.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
DROP DATABASE DB_to_Delete;
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p14.png)

We get the error message shown above. 
To be able to delete the database, it must not be in use. A simple workaround is to tell the system to use another database (here 'MyDB') and then execute the drop command. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
USE MyDB;
DROP DATABASE DB_to_Delete;
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p15.png)

Worked.

But what do we do if we do not have the possibility to switch to another database like here:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
USE MyDB;
DROP DATABASE MyDB;
```

![](/post/2021-03-07-create-a-database_files/p3p16.png)

At [SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) we also have the possibility to delete tables and databases via Object Explorer. 

To do this, we right-click on the database and select *Delete*. Don't forget to check the box 'Close existing connections'.

# 4 Conclusion

This was a small introduction to the topic of how to create databases and tables with SQL statements and fill them with values. Furthermore I showed how to delete columns, tables and whole databases.
