<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>After I have already reported on <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/">how to set up databases</a>, we now come to a very important topic that is related to this: What should I consider when setting up the data structure?</p>
<p>So in this post, I want to cover <strong>Database Normalization</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="theoretical-background" class="section level1">
<h1>2 Theoretical Background</h1>
<div id="what-is-normalization-in-a-database" class="section level2">
<h2>2.1 What is Normalization in a Database?</h2>
<p>Normalization is the process of reducing redundancy of data in the table and also improving data integrity.
Normalization split a large table into smaller tables and define relationships between them to increases the clarity in organizing data.</p>
</div>
<div id="problems-without-normalization" class="section level2">
<h2>2.2 Problems without Normalization</h2>
<p>Normalization is necessary because without normalization in SQL many problems can occur. These can be, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insertion Anomaly</strong>: It occurs when we cannot insert data into the table without another attribute being present.</li>
<li><strong>Update Anomaly</strong>: It is a data inconsistency that occurs due to data redundancy and partial update of data.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion Anomaly</strong>: It occurs when certain attributes are lost due to deletion of other attributes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="rules-for-data-normalization" class="section level2">
<h2>2.3 Rules for Data Normalization</h2>
<p>There are three main forms for Data Normalization:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Normal Form (1st NF)</li>
<li>Second Normal Form (2nd NF)</li>
<li>and Third Normal Form (3rd NF)</li>
</ul>
<p>Normalization was developed by <a href="https://history-computer.com/edgar-codd-creator-of-the-relational-database/">IBM researcher E.F. Codd</a> in the 1970s. In doing so, he established some rules for satisfying the normal forms.</p>
<p><strong>First Normal Form (1st NF)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Same Data Type in a Column.</li>
<li>There are only Single Valued Attributes.</li>
<li>There is a Unique name for every Attribute/Column.</li>
<li>Uniquely identify a Row.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second Normal Form (2nd NF)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be in 1st NF.</li>
<li>The table should also not contain Partial Dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third Normal Form (3rd NF)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be in 2nd NF.</li>
<li>The table should also not contain Transitive Dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="database-normalisation" class="section level1">
<h1>3 Database Normalisation</h1>
<p>In the following I will give examples that show how to bring unnormalized data into the next Normal Form.</p>
<div id="first-normal-form-1st-nf" class="section level2">
<h2>3.1 First Normal Form (1st NF)</h2>
<div id="same-data-type-in-a-column" class="section level3">
<h3>3.1.1 Same Data Type in a Column</h3>
<p>In order to work with data within a column in a meaningful way, it is mandatory that these data correspond to the same data type.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-05-16-normalization-of-databases_files/p22p1.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="there-are-only-single-valued-attributes" class="section level3">
<h3>3.1.2 There are only Single Valued Attributes</h3>
<p>Likewise, unnecessary duplicate columns must be avoided.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-05-16-normalization-of-databases_files/p22p2.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="there-is-a-unique-name-for-every-attributecolumn" class="section level3">
<h3>3.1.3 There is a Unique name for every Attribute/Column</h3>
<p>All information in an observation should be available for query. If several values are stored within one cell, this could cause problems.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-05-16-normalization-of-databases_files/p22p3.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="uniquely-identify-a-row" class="section level3">
<h3>3.1.4 Uniquely identify a Row</h3>
<p>Individual Observations must be identifiable. A good solution to the problem at hand would be to split the source table.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-05-16-normalization-of-databases_files/p22p4.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="digression-primary-key-vs.-foreign-key" class="section level3">
<h3>3.1.5 Digression: Primary Key vs. Foreign Key</h3>
<p>In the previous example we saw the use of primary keys and a foreign key. But what are these keys actually and what do I need them for?</p>
<p>A primary key is used to ensure that the data in a particular column is unique. The primary key must not contain NULL values or repeating values, is limited to a single table, and is set to uniquely identify the corresponding rows of a table. This is either an existing table column or a column that is specially generated by the database according to a defined sequence.</p>
<p>A foreign key is a column or a group of columns in a relational database table that refers to the primary key of the other table. It is responsible for managing the relationship between the tables. The table that contains the foreign key is usually called the child table. The table whose primary key is referenced by the foreign key is usually called the parent table.</p>
<p>The use of Primary Keys and Foreign Keys also have a protective function. For example, in the example above, if we want to add another phone number to the StudentsPhone table and I make a mistake with the Student_ID (for example, if I want to use one that doesn’t exist at all), I would get an insert error saying that this primary doesn’t exist at all in the parent table.</p>
</div>

<div id="second-normal-form-2nd-nf" class="section level2">
<h2>3.2 Second Normal Form (2nd NF)</h2>
<p>Now that we know what the first normal form must look like, we come to the second normal form.</p>
