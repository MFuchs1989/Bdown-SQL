# 1 Introduction

Following on from my post about [string functions](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/04/03/string-functions/), I would like to take this opportunity to discuss how to use the Dates data type.



# 2 Preparation


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SET LANGUAGE ENGLISH


CREATE DATABASE Dates_DB;

USE Dates_DB;
```

Important! In the following I will use the English spelling of dates. For this to work with our database / table `SET LANGUAGE ENGLISH` must be executed. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE Dates_Table
    (ID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
     Date_Column Date NOT NULL,
     Datetime_Column DATETIME NOT NULL)
    ;
```

Now we add one more line with sample data.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
INSERT INTO Dates_Table VALUES ('2021-05-19', '2021-05-19 15:22:15')
```


To get the current date, the INSERT command could also look like this:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# INSERT INTO Dates_Table VALUES (GETDATE(), GETUTCDATE())
```


This is our data set that we will work with:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Dates_Table
```

# 3 Working with Dates

## 3.1 Extract Year, Month and Day


Extraction of parts of a date or datetime can be done as follows:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT YEAR(Date_Column) AS _year, 
	   MONTH(Date_Column) AS _month, 
	   DAY(Date_Column) AS _day
	FROM Dates_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-07-working-with-dates_files/p23p2.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT YEAR(Datetime_Column) AS _year, 
	   MONTH(Datetime_Column) AS _month, 
	   DAY(Datetime_Column) AS _day
	FROM Dates_Table
	;
```

## 3.2 Extract Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second and iso week

Of course, much more detailed information can be extracted from a date as long as the file format allows it. 

For this purpose we use the DATEPART function.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT DATEPART(YEAR, Date_Column) AS _year, 
	   DATEPART(MONTH, Date_Column) AS _month, 
	   DATEPART(DAY, Date_Column) AS _day
	FROM Dates_Table
	;
```

Let's try the hours now.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT DATEPART(YEAR, Date_Column) AS _year, 
	   DATEPART(MONTH, Date_Column) AS _month, 
	   DATEPART(DAY, Date_Column) AS _day, 
	   DATEPART(HOUR, Date_Column) AS _hour
	FROM Dates_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-07-working-with-dates_files/p23p5.png)

This, of course, no longer works. This is what I meant earlier by 'as long as the file format allows'. 
The column Date_Column contains only date values, no other as it is the case for example with the Datetime. 

Let's try this column next.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT DATEPART(YEAR, Datetime_Column) AS _year, 
	   DATEPART(MONTH, Datetime_Column) AS _month, 
	   DATEPART(DAY, Datetime_Column) AS _day, 
	   DATEPART(HOUR, Datetime_Column) AS _hour, 
	   DATEPART(MINUTE, Datetime_Column) AS _minute, 
	   DATEPART(SECOND, Datetime_Column) AS _second
	FROM Dates_Table
	;
```

Works perfectly. We can also output the associated calendar week:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT DATEPART(ISO_WEEK, Datetime_Column) AS _iso_week
	FROM Dates_Table
	;
```

For example, if we want to get the name of the day or month, we can do this with the DATENAME function (here I have all parts of the date output as a name). 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT DATENAME (YEAR, Datetime_Column) AS _year_name,
	   DATENAME (MONTH, Datetime_Column) AS _month_name,
	   DATENAME (DAY, Datetime_Column) AS _day_name,
	   DATENAME (WEEKDAY, Datetime_Column) AS _weekday_name,
	   DATENAME (HOUR, Datetime_Column) AS _hour_name,
	   DATENAME (MINUTE, Datetime_Column) AS _minute_name,
	   DATENAME (SECOND, Datetime_Column) AS _second_name
	FROM Dates_Table
	;
```

## 3.3 ORDER and GROUP BY

Mostly one uses the ORDER or GROUP BY function with dates.

For these examples, I am still enriching our previous table with the following sample data:



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
INSERT INTO Dates_Table VALUES ('2021-02-12', '2021-02-12 15:22:15')
INSERT INTO Dates_Table VALUES ('2021-01-17', '2021-01-17 15:22:15')
INSERT INTO Dates_Table VALUES ('2021-04-22', '2021-04-22 15:22:15')
INSERT INTO Dates_Table VALUES ('2021-05-15', '2021-05-15 15:22:15')
INSERT INTO Dates_Table VALUES ('2021-03-01', '2021-03-01 15:22:15')
INSERT INTO Dates_Table VALUES ('2021-05-21', '2021-05-21 15:22:15')
INSERT INTO Dates_Table VALUES ('2021-05-20', '2021-05-20 15:22:15')
```


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Dates_Table;
```

Now a few Order By and Group By examples:



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID, Datetime_Column
	FROM Dates_Table
	ORDER BY Date_Column
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-07-working-with-dates_files/p23p10.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID, 
       DATEPART (DAY, Datetime_Column) AS _day
	FROM Dates_Table
	ORDER BY _day
	;
```

![](/post/2021-04-07-working-with-dates_files/p23p11.png)




```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT DATENAME (WEEKDAY, Datetime_Column), 
	   COUNT(*) AS count_weekday  
	FROM Dates_Table
	GROUP BY DATENAME (WEEKDAY, Datetime_Column)
	ORDER BY count_weekday DESC
	;
```

## 3.4 Time Span


What is used at least as often are the indications of time spans that lie between two dates. 

SQL Server also offers a command for this: DATEDIFF


For this purpose we will create another example table:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE Time_Span_Table
    (ID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
     Date_1 DATETIME NOT NULL,
     Date_2 DATETIME NOT NULL)
    ;
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
INSERT INTO Time_Span_Table VALUES ('2021-05-19 15:22:15', '2021-05-22 18:45:59')
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Time_Span_Table;
```

![](/post/2021-04-07-working-with-dates_files/p23p13.png)


The [syntax for DATEDIFF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datediff-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) is quite simple: `DATEDIFF ( datepart , startdate , enddate )  `

Here is an example:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT DATEDIFF (YEAR, Date_1, Date_2) AS _time_span_year,
	   DATEDIFF (MONTH, Date_1, Date_2) AS _time_span_month,
	   DATEDIFF (DAY, Date_1, Date_2) AS _time_span_day,
	   DATEDIFF (HOUR, Date_1, Date_2) AS _time_span_hour,
	   DATEDIFF (MINUTE, Date_1, Date_2) AS _time_span_minute,
	   DATEDIFF (SECOND, Date_1, Date_2) AS _time_span_second
	FROM Time_Span_Table
	;
```
