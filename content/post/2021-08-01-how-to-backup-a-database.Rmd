# 1 Introduction

If you want to work on a private database, it is advisable to back it up at regular intervals. 
How to do this with the Microsoft SQL Server Management I want to show you in this post. 


# 2 Preparation

For this post, I'm creating a sample database (*TestDB*) and including a sample table (*Example_Table*) here.

Since I would like to have the output of [SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) always in English I use the following syntax.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SET LANGUAGE ENGLISH
```


How I create the database and the tables can be read in my post [Create a Database](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#create-a-new-database). 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE DATABASE TestDB;

USE TestDB;


CREATE TABLE Example_Table
    (ID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
    ;
```

Now I'll insert some sample data in this table.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
INSERT INTO Example_Table VALUES ('Klara', 'Brown')
INSERT INTO Example_Table VALUES ('Jessy', 'Williams')
INSERT INTO Example_Table VALUES ('Emily', 'Taylor')



SELECT * FROM Example_Table
```

Okay has worked. Now we can get started.


# 3 Backup a Database

## 3.1 via SSMS Object Explorer

On the one hand, we have the possibility to backup the database using Object Explorer. 
To do this, right-click on the database 

![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p1.png)


and select *Tasks and Back Up..*. 

After that this window will open:

![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p2.png)

Backup type: Full is the right setting for our project. 
Below you can also see a suggested path for saving the backup under Destination. 
It was created automatically during the installation of [SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15). 


Now just press OK and the backup will be created. 


![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p3.png)

Here you can also see the created backup:

## 3.2 via SQL Query

Personally, I find the way via the Object Explorer a bit cumbersome and therefore prefer to use the possibility of a SQL query.

Here would be the syntax for it. You just have to name the database you want to backup and the location (I created a folder called 'backup' under my C drive).


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
BACKUP DATABASE TestDB TO DISK = 'C:\backup\TestDB.bak';
```


![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p5.png)

Again, we see the successfully saved file:

# 4 Restore a Database

Now that we know how to back up databases, I would like to show you how to load these backups. 

However, before that we need to delete the created database ('TestDB'). I have described how to do that in this post: [Create a Database 3.2.5 Delete the whole Database](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#delete-the-whole-database)



## 4.1 via SSMS Object Explorer

For the first variant we use the Object Explorer again.

To do this, right-click on the Databases folder 

![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p7.png)


and select *Restore Database..*.

This window will then open:



![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p8.png)


Select 'Device' as source and click on the three dots to select the path.

Click on 'Add'.

![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p9.png)


Navigate to your backup and select it. 

![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p10.png)


Now confirm twice with OK.

![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p11.png)

![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p12.png)


Done!


![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p13.png)

Let's test a short query:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * FROM Example_Table;
```

![](/post/2021-08-01-how-to-backup-a-database_files/p24p14.png)


Perfect queries work and the database is restored. 

We can also see this from the fact that the two files: 
+ TestDB.mdf and 
TestDB_log.ldf 

now appear here again:

## 4.2 via SQL Query

Also the recovery can be done via SQL query, if you want.

Here would be the necessary syntax for it:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
RESTORE DATABASE TestDB 
	FROM DISK = N'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup\TestDB.bak'
	;
```




# 5 Conclusion

In this post I showed how to create backups of databases with SQL Server and how to load them again.
