<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>After I showed in my last post <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/">how to create a SQL database</a> and how to insert tables with values into it, let’s go one step further.</p>
<p>As we know from the <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/03/entity-relationship-diagram-erd/">ERD post</a>, the tables in a database are always related to each other with some <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/03/entity-relationship-diagram-erd/#relationships">relationship</a>.</p>
<p>In this post I would like to point out a circumstance where it is a 1:1 relationship.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-assumed-situation" class="section level1">
<h1>2 The assumed Situation</h1>
<p>Let’s say we are asked to design a database for a registry office.
We have information about the groom and about the bride.
This information should be stored in a husband and a wife table which are in a 1:1 relationship to each other.
This means that each groom is assigned exactly one bride and vice versa.
I use the <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/03/entity-relationship-diagram-erd/#modified-chen-notation-mc-notation">Modified Chen Notation (MC Notation)</a> below.</p>

<div id="setting-up-the-database-and-the-required-tables" class="section level1">
<h1>3 Setting up the database and the required tables</h1>
<p>Since I would like to have the output of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15">SSMS</a> always in English I use the following syntax.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SET LANGUAGE ENGLISH</code></pre>
<p>How I create the database and the tables can be read in my post <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#create-a-new-database">Create a Database</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>CREATE DATABASE Registry_Office;


USE Registry_Office;

CREATE TABLE Husband
    (Husband_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
    ;

CREATE TABLE Wife
    (Wife_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
    ;</code></pre>
<p>Here is the result:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-10-create-a-1-1-relationship_files/p4p2.png" /></p>
<div id="primary-key" class="section level2">
<h2>3.1 Primary Key</h2>
<p>Short and sweet:</p>
<p>A primary key is used to ensure that the data in a particular column is unique. It is a column that must not contain null values. Either this column is already provided in the table or it is specially created by the database according to a defined sequence.</p>
<p>As you have probably already noticed, I had the columns <code>Husband_ID</code> and <code>Wife_ID</code> stored as Primary Key when I created the two tables. The relationship should be as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-10-create-a-1-1-relationship_files/p4p4.png" /></p>
<p>One can view the relationships of the tables stored in a database in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15">SSMS</a>. To do this, right-click on ‘Views’ in the Object Explorer and select ‘New View’. Afterwards you will be asked which tables should be displayed. Select your desired tables and click on OK.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-10-create-a-1-1-relationship_files/p4p3.png" /></p>
<p>What we see now is the following output:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-10-create-a-1-1-relationship_files/p4p5.png" /></p>
<p>Here, there is still no connection between the two tables … Why is that?
The answer has to do with the Foreign Key.</p>
</div>
<div id="foreign-key" class="section level2">
<h2>3.2 Foreign Key</h2>
<p>A foreign key is a column or a group of columns in a relational database table that creates a link between data in two tables. It is a column that refers to a column (usually the primary key) of another table.</p>
<p>We have not yet assigned this foreign key.
So we do this now as the next step.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="connecting-the-two-tables" class="section level1">
<h1>4 Connecting the two tables</h1>
<p>Since this is a 1:1 relationship, only one foreign key is needed. It does not matter in which table it is stored.
We add it to the ‘Husband’ table in this example.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ALTER TABLE Husband ADD Wife_ID INT NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Wife(Wife_ID);</code></pre>
<p>The underlying ERD now looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-10-create-a-1-1-relationship_files/p4p6.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s take another look at Views (via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15">SSMS</a>).</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-10-create-a-1-1-relationship_files/p4p7.png" /></p>
<p>Now we can also see in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15">SSMS</a> that and what relationship exists between the two tables.</p>
</div>
<div id="filling-the-tables" class="section level1">
<h1>5 Filling the tables</h1>
<p>To see how we can use this relationship we first fill the two tables with values.</p>
<p><strong>Important!</strong></p>
<p>First, the table <em>Wife</em> must be filled, as the stored Foreign Key (‘Wife_ID’) in the table <em>Husband</em> refers to this table (<em>Wife</em>).</p>
<p>Filling the Wife-Table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>INSERT INTO Wife (Wife_ID, First_Name, Last_Name) VALUES (1, &#39;Klara&#39;, &#39;Brown&#39;)
INSERT INTO Wife (Wife_ID, First_Name, Last_Name) VALUES (2, &#39;Jessy&#39;, &#39;Williams&#39;)
INSERT INTO Wife (Wife_ID, First_Name, Last_Name) VALUES (3, &#39;Emily&#39;, &#39;Taylor&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Filling the Husband-Table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>INSERT INTO Husband (Husband_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Wife_ID) VALUES (1, &#39;Max&#39;, &#39;Steel&#39;, 1)
INSERT INTO Husband (Husband_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Wife_ID) VALUES (2, &#39;Alex&#39;, &#39;Smith&#39;, 2)
INSERT INTO Husband (Husband_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Wife_ID) VALUES (3, &#39;Marc&#39;, &#39;Pike&#39;, 3)</code></pre>
<p>Have a look at the two filled tables:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * FROM Husband
SELECT * FROM Wife</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-10-create-a-1-1-relationship_files/p4p8.png" /></p>
<p>Now we perform a simple merge of the two tables using the Primary Key and Foreign Key.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * 
    FROM Husband JOIN Wife 
    ON Husband.Wife_ID = Wife.Wife_ID;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-10-create-a-1-1-relationship_files/p4p9.png" /></p>
<p>At this point, it should be mentioned that this is a rather simple combination that should exemplify the usefulness of primary and foreign keys.
I will report on the topic of how to execute joins correctly and sensibly in a later post.</p>
</div>
<div id="shorter-method" class="section level1">
<h1>6 Shorter method</h1>
<p>In the previous example, I first created two tables and added the Foreign Key afterwards. You can also add it right when you create the tables. I will show you how to do this in the following example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>CREATE DATABASE Registry_Office2;

USE Registry_Office2;


CREATE TABLE Wife
    (Wife_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
    ;


CREATE TABLE Husband
    (Husband_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Wife_ID INT NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Wife(Wife_ID))
    ;


SELECT * FROM Husband
SELECT * FROM Wife</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-10-create-a-1-1-relationship_files/p4p10.png" /></p>
<p>It is only important to create the wife table first, otherwise the error will be thrown that the column ‘Wife_ID’ from the table ‘Wife’ does not exist.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>7 Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this post I have shown a simple example of a 1:1 relationship of two tables and how to create them in a database respectively how to build the relationship to them among themselves accordingly.</p>
<p>In addition, I have shown how to output relationships of tables within a database from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15">SSMS</a>.</p>
<p>In subsequent posts, I will discuss other forms of relationships.</p>
