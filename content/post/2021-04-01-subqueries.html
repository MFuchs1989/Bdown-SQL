<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>You can usually get pretty far with SQL using simple queries like we’ve seen so far. You can get even further if you know how to use subqueries.</p>
<p>For this post I used the dataset <em>flight</em> from the statistics platform <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">“Kaggle”</a>. You can download it from my <a href="https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

<div id="subqueries" class="section level1">
<h1>3 Subqueries</h1>
<p>Here is a short explanation of the difference between Subqueries and Joins:</p>
<p><strong>Subquery</strong>: When an existing table needs to be manipulated or aggregated to then be joined to a larger table.</p>
<p><strong>Joins</strong>: A fully flexible and discretionary use case where a user wants to bring two or more tables together and select and filter as needed.</p>
<div id="subqueries-in-the-where-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>3.1 Subqueries in the WHERE statement</h2>
<p>For our first example, we will use the <strong>flight</strong> dataset.</p>
<p>There is a column there called ‘Dep_Delay’, which indicates the delay of aircraft departures.
Let’s take a look at the mean value for this column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT AVG(Dep_Delay) AS avg_dep_delay
    FROM flight
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p4.png" /></p>
<p>Now, if we want to look at which flights have a greater delay than this mean (22 minutes), we can write it like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Tai_lNum, Origin_Airport, Dep_Delay
    FROM flight
    WHERE Dep_Delay &gt; 22
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p5.png" /></p>
<p>But it is not very smart, because the calculated mean value was hard coded here.
There is another way to write this and that is with the help of Subqueries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Tai_lNum, Origin_Airport, Dep_Delay
    FROM flight
    WHERE Dep_Delay &gt; (SELECT AVG(Dep_Delay)
                        FROM flight)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p6.png" /></p>
<p>Here we insert a subquery that calculates the mean value to which the main query can then reference.</p>
</div>
<div id="nested-subqueries-in-the-where-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>3.2 Nested Subqueries in the WHERE statement</h2>
<p>Of course, you can also use several subqueries nested within each other. Let’s take a look at the following data set:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * 
    FROM flight_add_info
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p7.png" /></p>
<p>What do I want to know here?</p>
<p>I want to display the additional information such as manufacturer or aircraft type (data set <em>flight_add_info</em>) for the aircraft whose delayed departure in the data set <em>flight</em> is above the mean.</p>
<p>So we use the above query including subquery only with the addition <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/23/data-wrangling/#get-distinct-values">DISTINCT</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT DISTINCT Tai_lNum
    FROM flight
    WHERE Dep_Delay &gt; (SELECT AVG(Dep_Delay)
                        FROM flight)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p8.png" /></p>
<p>Based on this, I now want to add all information for which Tai_lNum I also have further information available in <em>flight_add_info</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT *
    FROM flight_add_info
    WHERE Tai_lNum IN (SELECT DISTINCT Tai_lNum
                        FROM flight
                        WHERE Dep_Delay &gt; (SELECT AVG(Dep_Delay)
                                            FROM flight))
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p9.png" /></p>
<p>For two numbers I had additional information available. Of course, there are other flight numbers (‘Tai_lNum’) in the <em>flight</em> dataset that were above the mean in terms of departure delay, but for which I did not have any additional information (the dataset was of course very very small).</p>
</div>
<div id="subqueries-in-the-from-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>3.3 Subqueries in the FROM statement</h2>
<p>So far we have written Subqueries in the WHERE statement. But this is also possible in the FROM statement.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at this part of the <em>flight</em> dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Flight_Date, Origin_Airport
    FROM flight
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p10.png" /></p>
<p>First I extract the day from the date (‘Flight_Date’) and count the observations grouped by the day from the Flight_Date and the Origin_Airport.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT DAY(Flight_Date) AS day, 
       Origin_Airport, 
       COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM flight
    GROUP BY DAY(Flight_Date), Origin_Airport
    ORDER BY DAY(Flight_Date), Origin_Airport
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p11.png" /></p>
<p>The output what you see above is my base (and therefore my following Subquery) for my main query.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When I want to use Subqueries in a SQL statement, I always start writing with them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Origin_Airport, AVG(event_count) AS avg_event_count
    FROM (SELECT DAY(Flight_Date) AS day, 
          Origin_Airport, 
          COUNT(*) AS event_count
            FROM flight
            GROUP BY DAY(Flight_Date), Origin_Airport) AS sub
    GROUP BY Origin_Airport
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p12.png" /></p>
<p>Based on the previously shown count (now integrated as a Subquery) I can now calculate the mean value of the counted observations grouped by Origin_Airport.</p>
