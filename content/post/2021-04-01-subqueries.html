<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>You can usually get pretty far with SQL using simple queries like we’ve seen so far. You can get even further if you know how to use subqueries.</p>
<p>For this post I used the dataset <em>flight</em> from the statistics platform <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">“Kaggle”</a>. You can download it from my <a href="https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

<div id="subqueries" class="section level1">
<h1>3 Subqueries</h1>
<p>Here is a short explanation of the difference between Subqueries and Joins:</p>
<p><strong>Subquery</strong>: When an existing table needs to be manipulated or aggregated to then be joined to a larger table.</p>
<p><strong>Joins</strong>: A fully flexible and discretionary use case where a user wants to bring two or more tables together and select and filter as needed.</p>
<div id="subqueries-in-the-where-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>3.1 Subqueries in the WHERE statement</h2>
<p>For our first example, we will use the <strong>flight</strong> dataset.</p>
<p>There is a column there called ‘Dep_Delay’, which indicates the delay of aircraft departures.
Let’s take a look at the mean value for this column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT AVG(Dep_Delay) AS avg_dep_delay
    FROM flight
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p4.png" /></p>
<p>Now, if we want to look at which flights have a greater delay than this mean (22 minutes), we can write it like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Tai_lNum, Origin_Airport, Dep_Delay
    FROM flight
    WHERE Dep_Delay &gt; 22
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p5.png" /></p>
<p>But it is not very smart, because the calculated mean value was hard coded here.
There is another way to write this and that is with the help of Subqueries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Tai_lNum, Origin_Airport, Dep_Delay
    FROM flight
    WHERE Dep_Delay &gt; (SELECT AVG(Dep_Delay)
                        FROM flight)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p6.png" /></p>
<p>Here we insert a subquery that calculates the mean value to which the main query can then reference.</p>
</div>
<div id="nested-subqueries-in-the-where-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>3.2 Nested Subqueries in the WHERE statement</h2>
<p>Of course, you can also use several subqueries nested within each other. Let’s take a look at the following data set:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * 
    FROM flight_add_info
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p7.png" /></p>
<p>What do I want to know here?</p>
<p>I want to display the additional information such as manufacturer or aircraft type (data set <em>flight_add_info</em>) for the aircraft whose delayed departure in the data set <em>flight</em> is above the mean.</p>
<p>So we use the above query including subquery only with the addition <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/23/data-wrangling/#get-distinct-values">DISTINCT</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT DISTINCT Tai_lNum
    FROM flight
    WHERE Dep_Delay &gt; (SELECT AVG(Dep_Delay)
                        FROM flight)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p8.png" /></p>
<p>Based on this, I now want to add all information for which Tai_lNum I also have further information available in <em>flight_add_info</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT *
    FROM flight_add_info
    WHERE Tai_lNum IN (SELECT DISTINCT Tai_lNum
                        FROM flight
                        WHERE Dep_Delay &gt; (SELECT AVG(Dep_Delay)
                                            FROM flight))
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p9.png" /></p>
<p>For two numbers I had additional information available. Of course, there are other flight numbers (‘Tai_lNum’) in the <em>flight</em> dataset that were above the mean in terms of departure delay, but for which I did not have any additional information (the dataset was of course very very small).</p>
</div>
<div id="subqueries-in-the-from-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>3.3 Subqueries in the FROM statement</h2>
<p>So far we have written Subqueries in the WHERE statement. But this is also possible in the FROM statement.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at this part of the <em>flight</em> dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Flight_Date, Origin_Airport
    FROM flight
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p10.png" /></p>
<p>First I extract the day from the date (‘Flight_Date’) and count the observations grouped by the day from the Flight_Date and the Origin_Airport.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT DAY(Flight_Date) AS day, 
       Origin_Airport, 
       COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM flight
    GROUP BY DAY(Flight_Date), Origin_Airport
    ORDER BY DAY(Flight_Date), Origin_Airport
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p11.png" /></p>
<p>The output what you see above is my base (and therefore my following Subquery) for my main query.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When I want to use Subqueries in a SQL statement, I always start writing with them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Origin_Airport, AVG(event_count) AS avg_event_count
    FROM (SELECT DAY(Flight_Date) AS day, 
          Origin_Airport, 
          COUNT(*) AS event_count
            FROM flight
            GROUP BY DAY(Flight_Date), Origin_Airport) AS sub
    GROUP BY Origin_Airport
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p12.png" /></p>
<p>Based on the previously shown count (now integrated as a Subquery) I can now calculate the mean value of the counted observations grouped by Origin_Airport.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="exists-operator" class="section level1">
<h1>4 EXISTS Operator</h1>
<p>The EXISTS Operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a Subquery.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to check if the Tai_lNums in this table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * 
    FROM flight_add_info
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p13.png" /></p>
<p>are also found in my large <em>flight</em> table (of course also within the column ‘Tai_lNum’), I can use the following command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT DISTINCT Tai_lNum
    FROM flight
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT Tai_lNum
                    FROM flight_add_info
                    WHERE flight_add_info.Tai_lNum = flight.Tai_lNum)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p14.png" /></p>
<p>Fits perfectly. Two of the deposited numbers can also be found in <em>flight</em>.
Now I display how often these numbers appear in <em>flight</em>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Tai_lNum, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM flight
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT Tai_lNum
                    FROM flight_add_info
                    WHERE flight_add_info.Tai_lNum = flight.Tai_lNum)
    GROUP BY Tai_lNum
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p15.png" /></p>
<p>This output can also be obtained by using the IN Clause:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT DISTINCT Tai_lNum
    FROM flight
    WHERE Tai_lNum IN (SELECT DISTINCT Tai_lNum
                        FROM flight_add_info)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p16.png" /></p>
<p>The IN is best used where you have a static list to pass like <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/23/data-wrangling/#with-lists">here</a>.</p>
<p>Based on rule optimizer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EXISTS</strong> is much faster than IN, when the sub-query results is very large.</li>
<li><strong>IN</strong> is faster than EXISTS, when the sub-query results is very small.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXISTS</strong> will be faster because once the engine has found a hit, it will quit looking as the condition has proved true.</p>
<p>With <strong>IN</strong>, it will collect all the results from the sub-query before further processing.</p>
</div>
<div id="any-and-all-operator" class="section level1">
<h1>5 ANY and ALL Operator</h1>
<p>Do I need more operators if I already have <strong>IN</strong>? Yes, because there is a very important difference between ANY/ALL and IN:</p>
<ul>
<li>With <strong>ANY or ALL</strong> you must place an =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, or &gt;= operator before ANY/ALL.</li>
<li>But with the <strong>IN</strong> operator you cannot use =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, or &gt;=.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get the last shown outputs (using <strong>EXISTS</strong> and <strong>IN</strong>) with ANY, I have to write the syntax as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT DISTINCT Tai_lNum
    FROM flight
    WHERE Tai_lNum = ANY (SELECT Tai_lNum
                            FROM flight_add_info
                            WHERE flight_add_info.Tai_lNum = flight.Tai_lNum)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p17.png" /></p>
<p>To understand ANY and ALL even better, let’s consider the following example (dataset <em>customers</em>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT *
    FROM customers
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p18.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the people (we only let the age of the people output) whose income is greater than 5,000.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Age 
    FROM customers 
    WHERE Salary &gt; 5000
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p19.png" /></p>
<p>Now we use ANY once and ALL once in the WHERE statement:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * 
    FROM customers 
    WHERE Age &gt; ANY(SELECT Age 
                        FROM customers 
                        WHERE Salary &gt; 5000)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p20.png" /></p>
<p>All persons whose age is greater than 23 <strong>or</strong> 27 are output here.</p>
<p>Now with ALL:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * 
    FROM customers 
    WHERE Age &gt; ALL(SELECT Age 
                        FROM customers 
                        WHERE Salary &gt; 5000)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-01-subqueries_files/p12p21.png" /></p>
<p>Only persons whose age is greater than 27 are output here.</p>
<p>Here again IN, ANY and ALL in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>IN: Equals to Anything in the List</li>
<li>ANY: Compares Value to Each Value Returned by the Sub Query</li>
<li>ALL: Compares Value To Every Value Returned by the Sub Query</li>
</ul>
</div>
