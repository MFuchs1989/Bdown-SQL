<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>In my last post I showed how to set up and use a <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/10/create-a-1-1-relationship/">1:1 relationship</a> between two tables.</p>
<p>Now I want to show the same for a <strong>1:m relationship</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-assumed-situation" class="section level1">
<h1>2 The assumed Situation</h1>
<p>Let’s say we are asked to develop a database for a school. In this school there are several teachers who are assigned to different classes with n pupils. A typical 1:m relationship between the teacher and the different students in a class.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/03/entity-relationship-diagram-erd/#modified-chen-notation-mc-notation">Modified Chen Notation (MC Notation)</a> below.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-13-create-a-1-m-relationship_files/p5p1.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-the-database-and-the-required-tables" class="section level1">
<h1>3 Setting up the database and the required tables</h1>
<p>How I do this can be read in my post <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#create-a-new-database">Create a Database</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>CREATE DATABASE School_Class;


USE School_Class;

CREATE TABLE Pupils
    (Pupils_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
    ;


CREATE TABLE Teacher
    (Teacher_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Last_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Subject_ VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
    ;</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you also have the option of storing the foreign key when creating the tables so that you don’t have to insert it afterwards, as in this example (see next step). Of course, you have to pay attention to the order in which you create the tables. I have described this in <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/10/create-a-1-1-relationship/#shorter-method">my previous post here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="connecting-the-two-tables" class="section level1">
<h1>4 Connecting the two tables</h1>
<p>Since this is a 1:m relationship, the foreign key should be stored in the table where multiple matches are possible.
In this case it would be the pupil table.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ALTER TABLE Pupils ADD Teacher_ID INT NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Teacher(Teacher_ID);</code></pre>
<p>The underlying ERD now looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-13-create-a-1-m-relationship_files/p5p2.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s also look again at the relationship of the two tables under Views in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15">SSMS</a>. I have described how to do this <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/10/create-a-1-1-relationship/#primary-key">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-13-create-a-1-m-relationship_files/p5p3.png" /></p>
<p>Using the infinity symbol in the output, we can see that a primary key is referencing a foreign key.</p>
</div>
<div id="filling-the-tables" class="section level1">
<h1>5 Filling the tables</h1>
<p>To see how we can use this relationship we first fill the two tables with values.</p>
<p><strong>Important!</strong></p>
<p>Again, it is important to pay attention to the order of filling. The <em>Teacher</em> table must be filled first, as the foreign key (‘Teacher_ID’) is stored in the <em>Pupils</em> table and references the other table (<em>Teacher</em>).</p>
<p>Filling the Teacher-Table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>INSERT INTO Teacher (Teacher_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Subject_) VALUES (317, &#39;Andrew&#39;, &#39;Evergreen&#39;, &#39;History&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Filling the Pupils-Table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>INSERT INTO Pupils (Pupils_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Teacher_ID) VALUES (1, &#39;Max&#39;, &#39;Steel&#39;, 317)
INSERT INTO Pupils (Pupils_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Teacher_ID) VALUES (2, &#39;Jessy&#39;, &#39;Williams&#39;, 317)
INSERT INTO Pupils (Pupils_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Teacher_ID) VALUES (3, &#39;Marc&#39;, &#39;Pike&#39;, 317)
INSERT INTO Pupils (Pupils_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Teacher_ID) VALUES (4, &#39;Emily&#39;, &#39;Taylor&#39;, 317)
INSERT INTO Pupils (Pupils_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Teacher_ID) VALUES (5, &#39;Alex&#39;, &#39;Smith&#39;, 317)</code></pre>
<p>Have a look at the two filled tables:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * FROM Pupils
SELECT * FROM Teacher</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-13-create-a-1-m-relationship_files/p5p4.png" /></p>
<p>Now we perform a simple merge of the two tables using the Primary Key and Foreign Key.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * 
    FROM Pupils JOIN Teacher 
    ON Pupils.Teacher_ID = Teacher.Teacher_ID;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-13-create-a-1-m-relationship_files/p5p5.png" /></p>
<p>Again, I would like to point out that only a simple join was made for illustrative purposes. I will report on the topic of how to execute joins correctly and sensibly in a later article.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>6 Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this post I showed how to set up a 1:m relationship between two tables and make sense of it.</p>
<p>In my next post I will explain the structure and use of an m:m relationship.</p>
