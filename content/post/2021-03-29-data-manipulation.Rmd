# 1 Introduction

Next post this time about the topic of data manipulation.

Almost no data set in real life does not need to be modified in some way. Therefore, you should familiarize yourself with the most common methods of manipulating data. 


# 2 Preparation

For the following examples I create a new database and a new table.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SET LANGUAGE ENGLISH


CREATE DATABASE Manipulation;

USE Manipulation;
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE example_Table
    (Cat1 VARCHAR(100),
    Cat2 INT,
	Title VARCHAR(100),
    First_Name VARCHAR(100),
    Middle_Name VARCHAR(15),
	Last_Name VARCHAR(100),
	Age INT,
	LastOrderDate DATE,
	LastWebSearchDate DATE,
	LastInquiryDate DATE,
	LastPaymentDate DATE)
    ;
```


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
INSERT INTO example_Table (Cat1, Cat2, Title, First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name, Age, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, 
	LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) VALUES ('A', 1, 'Mr', 'Alex', NULL, 'Smith', 18, '2021-03-02', NULL, NULL, NULL)
INSERT INTO example_Table (Cat1, Cat2, Title, First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name, Age, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, 
	LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) VALUES ('A', 2, 'Miss', 'Cindy', 'J.', 'Steel', 34, NULL, '2021-03-22', NULL, NULL)
INSERT INTO example_Table (Cat1, Cat2, Title, First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name, Age, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, 
	LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) VALUES ('A', NULL, 'Mrs', 'Jessy', 'Kathrin', 'Williams', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-02-27', NULL)
INSERT INTO example_Table (Cat1, Cat2, Title, First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name, Age, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, 
	LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) VALUES ('B', 1, 'Miss', 'Sarah', NULL, 'Pike', 37, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-02-15')
INSERT INTO example_Table (Cat1, Cat2, Title, First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name, Age, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, 
	LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) VALUES ('B', 2, 'Ms', 'Emily', 'C.', 'Taylor', 40, '2021-03-27', NULL, NULL, NULL)
INSERT INTO example_Table (Cat1, Cat2, Title, First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name, Age, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, 
	LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) VALUES ('B', 3, 'Mrs', 'Clara', NULL, 'Wood', 50, NULL, '2021-01-29', NULL, NULL)
INSERT INTO example_Table (Cat1, Cat2, Title, First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name, Age, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, 
	LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) VALUES (NULL, 4, 'Mr', 'Andrew', 'John', 'Evergreen', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-03-05', NULL)
INSERT INTO example_Table (Cat1, Cat2, Title, First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name, Age, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, 
	LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) VALUES ('B', NULL, 'Ms', 'Emilia', 'Alina', 'Fox', 24, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-01-18')
INSERT INTO example_Table (Cat1, Cat2, Title, First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name, Age, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, 
	LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) VALUES ('B', NULL, 'Miss', 'Elisabeth', NULL, 'Field', 37, '2021-04-01', NULL, NULL, NULL)
```


This is what our data set looks like so far:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT *
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

# 3 Set Index

As you may have noticed earlier, our dataset does not yet have an index. Therefore I would like to present two methods that can be used here:

## 3.1 Creat an Index via Primary Key

On the one hand, we can use a primary key, which every table should have anyway.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ALTER TABLE example_Table ADD ID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY;

SELECT ID
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p2.png)

The disadvantage here is if you want to use this only for a temporary index, that you can no longer delete it, which of course also makes sense. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ALTER TABLE example_Table DROP COLUMN ID;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p3.png)


## 3.2 Creat an Index via a new Column (recommended)

A better method would be to first generate a new column in the data set and then fill it with a consecutive number.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ALTER TABLE example_Table ADD Idx INT;

SELECT ID, Idx
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p4.png)

Now we fill the new column:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
DECLARE @Idx INT 
SET @Idx = 0 
UPDATE example_Table 
SET @Idx = Idx = @Idx + 1 

SELECT ID, Idx
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p5.png)

We can delete these again at will. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ALTER TABLE example_Table DROP COLUMN Idx;

SELECT *
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

# 4 Replacing Values

What happens very often is that you want / need to replace certain values with others. 

## 4.1 Replace NULL Values (ISNULL)

Let's take a look at this part of the data set:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT Cat1, Cat2
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p7.png)

With ISNULL we have the possibility to replace NULL values from columns with other values.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT Cat1, Cat2,
	   ISNULL(Cat1, 'Unknown') AS non_null_Cat1,
	   ISNULL(Cat2, 999) AS non_null_Cat2
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p8.png)


**Hint**. in other SQL languages the syntax is different:

+ MySQL = IFNULL()
+ MS Access = IsNull()
+ Oracle = NVL()


ISNULL can also be used nested:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT Cat1, 
	   AVG(ISNULL(Cat2, 10)) AS avg_non_null_Cat2, 
	   AVG(Cat2) AS avg_with_null_Cat2
	FROM example_Table
	GROUP BY Cat1
	HAVING Cat1 = 'A' OR Cat1 = 'B'
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p9.png)

To track the calculation even better see the modified syntax here: 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT Cat1, 
	   AVG(ISNULL(Cat2, 10)) AS avg_non_null_Cat2, 
	   AVG(Cat2) AS avg_with_null_Cat2,
	   Count(ISNULL(Cat2, 10)) AS num_abs_non_null_Cat2,
	   Count(Cat2) AS num_abs_with_null_Cat2,
	   SUM(ISNULL(Cat2, 10)) AS sum_non_null_Cat2,
	   SUM(Cat2) AS sum_with_null_Cat2
	FROM example_Table
	GROUP BY Cat1
	HAVING Cat1 = 'A' OR Cat1 = 'B'
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p10.png)

Let's take a look at Cat1, B (non NULL): 26/5 = 5.2 = 5
Works fine!


## 4.2 Replace Values with NULL (NULLIF)

The same game goes around in the other direction. Let's take a look at this part:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p11.png)


Now I want to specifically set some values to NULL 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID,
	   NULLIF(ID, 8) AS null_if_ID
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p12.png)


This is of course only possible because I have preset that the column ID may also contain NULL values (which is normally not the case, especially not if it is the primary key):

Limitation: only one value can be set as NULL in this way.

If we want to set several values to NULL or replace several values with new ones we have to resort to another function: CASE.


## 4.3 IF Else Statemtents in SQL (CASE)

Let's give this a try:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID,
		CASE 
			WHEN ID = 7 THEN NULL
			WHEN ID = 8 THEN NULL
			WHEN ID = 9 THEN NULL
			ELSE ID
		END AS ID_with_null
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p13.png)

ELSE is optional here, if nothing is defined a NULL value would be returned 

As already mentioned, you can not only set values to ZERO with NULL, but also pass other values. See the following example:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID, Title
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p14.png)

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID, Title,
		CASE 
			WHEN Title = 'Mr' THEN 'Male'
			WHEN Title = 'Mrs' THEN 'Female'
			WHEN Title = 'Miss' THEN 'Female'
			WHEN Title = 'Ms' THEN 'Female'
			ELSE 'Unknown'
		END AS Gender
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p15.png)

CASE is a very useful function but it also requires a lot of typing.
If the situation allows it, you can also use a simple If statement.



## 4.4 IF Statemtents in SQL (IIF)

The syntax is very simple but of course somewhat limited: *IIF(boolean_expression,true_value,false_value)*
It must be a valid boolean value, or the function will raise an error.

Here is a simple example:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT IIF(500<1000, 'true', 'false') AS _500_is_less_than_1000;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p16.png)

Since we have only one title notation for the man in the example shown above, we can also apply the IIF in this case. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID, Title,
	   IIF(Title = 'Mr', 'M', 'F') AS Gender
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p17.png)


IIF also works wonderfully with local variables:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
DECLARE @BankBalance INT = 150;

SELECT IIF(@BankBalance > 100, 'Rich!', 'Poor');
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p18.png)


Even nested is no problem:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
DECLARE @bankBalance INT = 120;

SELECT IIF(
    @BankBalance > 100, 
		IIF(@BankBalance > 150, 'Rich!', 'Wealthy'), 
    'Poor'
    );
```

## 4.5 COALESCE

[COALESCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/coalesce-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) is a more difficult function but super helpful in some situations that I will show you in a moment: 


### 4.5.1 Replace NULL Values with the columns'average

As a Data Scientist, I don't like to throw away NULL values, as this would result in the loss of unnecessary information (for example, during model training). A smarter solution is to use other metrics, such as the mean value of the column.

Let's have a look here: 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT First_Name, Age
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p20.png)

If you have enough data, you can use the mean value for the missing lines.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT First_Name, Age,
	   COALESCE(Age, AVG(Age) over ()) as new_Age
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p21.png)

### 4.5.2 Coalesce for String Concatenation

Let's have a look at this part:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p22.png)

As I have already written [here](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/23/data-wrangling/#with-text-1), it is very easy to link text variables in SQL.

Let's see if this works in our case as well...

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name,
	   First_Name + ' ' + Middle_Name + ' ' + Last_Name AS Full_Name
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p23.png)

No, unfortunately not. But COALESCE can help here:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT First_Name, Middle_Name, Last_Name,
	   First_Name + ' ' + COALESCE(Middle_Name, '') + ' ' + Last_Name AS Full_Name
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p24.png)


### 4.5.3 Compare SQL Server COALESCE to CASE

Once you understand [COALESCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/coalesce-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15), you can save yourself a lot of typing again. See the example below:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT First_Name, LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate 
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p25.png)

Here I want to generate a column that shows the Last Activity Date.
I can do this with COALESCE as well as with CASE.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT First_Name, 
	   COALESCE(LastOrderDate, LastWebSearchDate, LastInquiryDate, LastPaymentDate) AS LastActivityDate
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p26.png)

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT First_Name,
		CASE 
			WHEN LastOrderDate IS NOT NULL THEN LastOrderDate
			WHEN LastWebSearchDate IS NOT NULL THEN LastWebSearchDate
			WHEN LastInquiryDate IS NOT NULL THEN LastInquiryDate
			WHEN LastPaymentDate IS NOT NULL THEN LastPaymentDate
		END AS LastActivityDate
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p27.png)

However, it is simply much faster with COALESCE.


### 4.5.4 Compare SQL Server COALESCE to ISNULL

I often hear that COALESCE works just like ISNULL. But this is only partly true and you should be aware of the differences, otherwise you may be in for a nasty surprise. 

For this reason I have taken the time to explain the difference here with an own example. 

I create a small table for this purpose:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
CREATE TABLE COALESCE_Table (Char_Variable VARCHAR(10))

INSERT INTO COALESCE_Table VALUES(NULL)

SELECT * FROM COALESCE_Table
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p28.png)

Now I use ISNULL to replace the NULL value with a short text.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT Char_Variable, 
	   ISNULL(Char_Variable, 'some_Text') AS filled_Char_Var
	FROM COALESCE_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p29.png)

Works as expected. But what about when I want to insert a longer text?


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT Char_Variable, 
	   ISNULL(Char_Variable, 'some_very_long_Text') AS filled_Char_Var
	FROM COALESCE_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p30.png)

The text will be truncated. This is also intentional, because I have set a limit of 10 characters for this column when I created the table.

Now let's see what COALESCE does here:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT Char_Variable,
	   COALESCE(Char_Variable, 'some_very_long_Text') AS filled_Char_Var
	FROM COALESCE_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p31.png)

Here we get the complete string returned, regardless of the type of Char_Variable.

That is, while ISNULL guarantees us type safety, COALESCE can only do so to a limited extent. That means, if your application depends on a type safety in the return, then you are always on the safe side with ISNULL.

Another example to make it even clearer (this time with a numeric variable):


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ALTER TABLE COAlESCE_Table ADD Num_Variable INT 

SELECT * FROM COALESCE_Table
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p32.png)

Here I use both ISNULL and COALESCE in one example so the difference is immediately apparent.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT Num_Variable,
	   5 / ISNULL(Num_Variable, 2.00) AS _ISNULL, 
	   5 / COALESCE(Num_Variable, 2.00) AS _COALESCE
	FROM COALESCE_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p33.png)

What happens now is that due to the type safety of ISNULL, the 2.00 is returned as the INT value 2, which has the consequence that the 5 is divided by the INT 2. Here the SQL server then returns the INT value, so we get the 2 as return value.

In the case of COALESCE, SQL Server decides to convert to the 2.00 data type, i.e. to perform an implicit conversion. This way we divide 5 by a floating point number, which results in a floating point number, so we get the correct value of 2.5 here (with some decimal places).


# 5 Rename Columns

Of course, you can assign [Aliases](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/19/aliases/) with each select statement and then you have renamed the column.
But you can also rename them permanently!

Caution here the columns of the table are renamed! Other statements that access the old names would no longer work.

For this example we use the table from the previous example:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * 
	FROM COALESCE_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p34.png)

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
EXEC sp_rename 'COALESCE_Table.Char_Variable', 'C_Var', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'COALESCE_Table.Num_Variable', 'N_Var', 'COLUMN';
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * 
	FROM COALESCE_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p35.png)


# 6 Delete Duplicates

Again, the note that lines are completely lost!

I have shown how to select Duplicate in a Select Statement in this post: [Data Wrangling - Drop Duplicates](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/23/data-wrangling/#drop-duplicates)

Now we don't want to drop the rows but delete them completely.
With the following statement SELECT MIN(ID) only the first value will be kept in the table, the others will be deleted (except for the observation with the NULL Value, which we will exclude in this example). 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID, Cat1 
	FROM example_Table
	WHERE Cat1 IS NOT NULL
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p36.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
DELETE FROM example_Table 
	WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT MIN(ID)
					FROM example_Table 
					GROUP BY Cat1)
	AND Cat1 IS NOT NULL;
```

Let's take a look at what's left:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID, Cat1 
	FROM example_Table
	WHERE Cat1 IS NOT NULL
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p37.png)

And now again the data set without restrictions:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT ID, Cat1 
	FROM example_Table
	;
```

![](/post/2021-03-29-data-manipulation_files/p11p38.png)




# 7 Conclusion

That's it for now. 
I didn't get all the available functions for data manipulation in this post but I will write another one about SQL Server functions and link to all relevant places.
