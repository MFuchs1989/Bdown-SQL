# 1 Introduction

After I have already reported on [how to set up databases](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/), we now come to a very important topic that is related to this: What should I consider when setting up the data structure? 

So in this post, I want to cover **Database Normalization**.


# 2 What is Normalization in a Database?


Normalization is the process of reducing redundancy of data in the table and also improving data integrity. 
Normalization split a large table into smaller tables and define relationships between them to increases the clarity in organizing data.


This is necessary because **without normalization** in SQL **many problems can occur**. These can be, for example:

+ **Insertion Anomaly**: It occurs when we cannot insert data into the table without another attribute being present.
+ **Update Anomaly**: It is a data inconsistency that occurs due to data redundancy and partial update of data.
+ **Deletion Anomaly**: It occurs when certain attributes are lost due to deletion of other attributes.


There are **three main forms**: 

+ First Normal Form (1st NF)
+ Second Normal Form (2nd NF)
+ and Third Normal Form (3rd NF)


Normalization was developed by [IBM researcher E.F. Codd](https://history-computer.com/edgar-codd-creator-of-the-relational-database/) in the 1970s. In doing so, he established some rules for satisfying the normal forms.


**First Normal Form (1st NF)**

+ Same Data Type in a Column.
+ There are only Single Valued Attributes.
+ There is a Unique name for every Attribute/Column.
+ Uniquely identify a Row.


**Second Normal Form (2nd NF)**

+ Be in 1st NF.
+ The table should also not contain Partial Dependencies.


**Third Normal Form (3rd NF)**

+ Be in 2nd NF.
+ The table should also not contain Transitive Dependencies.




# 3 Database Normalisation

In the following I will give examples that show how to bring unnormalized data into the next normal form. 


# 3.1 First Normal Form (1st NF)


**Same Data Type in a Column.**
