# 1 Introduction

After I have already written some posts about different SQL functions I would like to write a structure-bringing publication at this point again. 

In the following I will explain the different SQL command types:

+ Data Definition Language (DDL)
+ Data Query Language (DQL) 
+ Data Manipulation Language (DML)
+ Data Control Language (DCL)
+ Transaction Control Language (TCL)


# 2 Types of SQL Commands


## 2.1 Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL describes the SQL commands that can be used to define a database schema. They are mostly used for creating and changing the structure of database objects in the database. 

Examples of DDL commands:

+ [CREATE](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#create-a-new-table) - create the database or its objects
+ [DROP](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#delete-the-whole-table) - delete objects 
+ [ALTER](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/10/create-a-1-1-relationship/#connecting-the-two-tables) - alter the structure of objects
+ [TRUNCATE](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#delete-the-entire-content) - remove all records from a table



## 2.2 Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL statements are used to query data within schema objects. 

An example of this would be:

+ [SELECT](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#a-glimpse-at-the-new-table) - retrieve data from the database



## 2.3 Data Manipulation Language (DML)

The commands from this category deal with the manipulation of the data inside the database. 

Examples of DML commands:


+ [INSERT](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#inserting-values-into-the-table) - insert data into a table
+ [UPDATE](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/05/08/update-a-table/#update-command) - update existing data within a table
+ [DELETE](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/07/create-a-database/#delete-specific-rows) - delete records from a database table


## 2.4 Data Control Language (DCL)
