# 1 Introduction

After I have already written some posts about different SQL functions I would like to write a structure-bringing publication at this point again. 

In the following I will explain the different SQL command types:

+ Data Definition Language (DDL)
+ Data Query Language (DQL) 
+ Data Manipulation Language (DML)
+ Data Control Language(DCL)
+ Transaction Control Language(TCL)


# 2 Types of SQL Commands


## 2.1 Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL describes the SQL commands that can be used to define a database schema. They are mostly used for creating and changing the structure of database objects in the database. 

Examples of DDL commands:












```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

```
