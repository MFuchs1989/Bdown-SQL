# 1 Introduction

In my post [Entity-Relationship-Diagram](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/03/entity-relationship-diagram-erd/) I talked in detail about how databases should look like and how their cardinality can be represented. 
I have done this so far with [Drawio](https://app.diagrams.net/). 
But now I have found a program that not only allows you to design ERDs faster and nicer, but also to use other features like the automatic creation of underlying [DDLs](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/05/13/types-of-sql-commands/#data-definition-language-ddl): 

**Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler** 



# 2 Installations and Setup

## 2.1 Downlaod Data Modeler

First of all you need to download Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler via this link: [Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler -  Download](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sql-data-modeler-downloads.html)


To download the ZIP file, you need to create an Oracle account. In the course of the download attempt, there will be a prompt for this from Oracle.

Now unzip the downloaded file and place it in a location of your choice. 
You will find the application at the highest folder level.
Folder as well as application file can be renamed as you like.  


## 2.2 Downlaod Java SDK

To use Oracle Data Modeler you still need Java SDK (version less than 11.1).
You can download it here: [Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html
)

Tip: Download the zip file, extract it and place it in the Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler folder. 


The first time you run the Data Modeler (datamodeler.exe) you will be asked to set the path to the jdk file.

Set the path accordingly and the Data Modeler will work.



## 2.3 Change Language


If you want to change the language of the Data Modeler then search the datamodeler.conf file.
You can find it under the following path:

![](/post/2021-09-01-oracle-sql-developer-data-modeler_files/p25p2.png)

Open the file and insert (at any place) the following lines. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
#GUI language
AddVMOption -Duser.language=en
#AddVMOption -Duser.language=de
#AddVMOption -Duser.language=fr
#AddVMOption -Duser.language=it
#AddVMOption -Duser.language=es
```

In this example I have chosen the language English. 
If you like, you can set the language of your choice (just uncomment the corresponding line and comment out the rest).


I have only listed the most common languages here. Here would be a list with other languages that can be deposited:

# 3 Oracle - Data Modeler

At the beginning you will find an empty design with a Logical and a Relational Writer.
To create the ERD, we will first work with the Logical.

Click New Entity at the top of the toolbar.

Then you can click anywhere in the Logical Writer to create the first table.

The following window opens:
