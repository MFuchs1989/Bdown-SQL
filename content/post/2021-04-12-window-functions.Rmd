# 1 Introduction

After I have reported in my last post about String Functions, we now come to a topic which I would call Advanced Functions. Among other things, this includes the Window Functions of SQL.

For this post I used the dataset *company*. You can download it from my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets).



# 2 Preparation

For the following examples, I set up a new database.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SET LANGUAGE ENGLISH


CREATE DATABASE Window;

USE Window;
```

I now import the record *company* into this database ('Window'). I have described how to do this [here](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/20/read-and-write-to-files/#via-ssms).



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
SELECT * 
	FROM company
	;
```
