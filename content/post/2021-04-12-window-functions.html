<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>After I have reported in my last post about String Functions, we now come to a topic which I would call Advanced Functions. Among other things, this includes the Window Functions of SQL.</p>
<p>For this post I used the dataset <em>company</em>. You can download it from my <a href="https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="preparation" class="section level1">
<h1>2 Preparation</h1>
<p>For the following examples, I set up a new database.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SET LANGUAGE ENGLISH


CREATE DATABASE Window;

USE Window;</code></pre>
<p>I now import the record <em>company</em> into this database (‘Window’). I have described how to do this <a href="https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/20/read-and-write-to-files/#via-ssms">here</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT * 
    FROM company
    ;</code></pre>

<p><strong>Get an Overview:</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT MIN(StartDate) AS oldest_start_date,
       MAX(StartDate) AS latest_start_date,
       COUNT(*) AS total_num_employees 
    FROM company
    ;</code></pre>

<div id="window-functions" class="section level1">
<h1>3 Window Functions</h1>
<p>First of all, what is a Window Function?</p>
<p>The term <a href="https://drill.apache.org/docs/sql-window-functions-introduction/">window</a> describes the set of rows on which the function operates. A <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions/">window function</a> uses values from the rows in a window to calculate the returned values.</p>
<div id="simple-window-function" class="section level2">
<h2>3.1 Simple Window Function</h2>
<p>So far, I have solved such tasks in this way:</p>
<p>Here I want to view which people joined the company in <strong>January 2020</strong> and how many there were in total for the month.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname, 
       DATENAME(month, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + DATENAME(year, StartDate) AS Date_Started,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) 
            FROM company
            WHERE MONTH(StartDate) = 1 AND YEAR(StartDate) = 2020) AS total_num_employees_for_january_2020
    FROM company
    WHERE MONTH(StartDate) = 1 AND YEAR(StartDate) = 2020
    ORDER BY StartDate
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p3.png" /></p>
<p>I use the subquery to calculate how many people were hired in January 2020 and get this information tailored to the same time period (second WHERE statement) for each person.</p>
<p>This time with a window function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname, 
       DATENAME(month, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + DATENAME(year, StartDate) AS Date_Started, 
       COUNT(*) OVER() As total_num_employees_for_january_2020
    FROM company
    WHERE MONTH(StartDate) = 1 AND YEAR(StartDate) = 2020
    ORDER BY StartDate
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p4.png" /></p>
<p>Same output, less code!</p>
<p>Now I no longer filter by january but have <strong>all employees</strong> who started between 2019 and 2020 output:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname, 
       DATENAME(day, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(month, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(year, StartDate) AS Date_Started, 
       COUNT(*) OVER() As total_num_employees
    FROM company
    ORDER BY StartDate
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p5.png" /></p>
<p>Based on the output, we can see that Zula (first person in the table) was one of 1804 people hired in 2019-2020. For the used window functions all possible aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() … can be used.</p>
</div>
<div id="partition-by-order-by" class="section level2">
<h2>3.2 PARTITION BY &amp; ORDER BY</h2>
<p>Partitions allow you to filter the window into sections by certain values. Each section is called the window frame. Partition by is the ‘group by’ equivalent in a window functions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname, 
       DATENAME(day, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(month, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(year, StartDate) AS Date_Started, 
       COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY StartDate) As total_num_employees
    FROM company
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p6.png" /></p>
<p>Here we see that Zula (line 1) was one of 7 people who started on 01/01/2019. In contrast, only one person started on 01/02/2019: Jennette (line 8).</p>
<p>If we use only ORDER BY instead of PARTITION BY in the OVER statement we get an aggregation of the variable ‘total_num_employees’.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname, 
       DATENAME(day, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(month, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(year, StartDate) AS Date_Started, 
       COUNT(*) OVER(ORDER BY StartDate) As total_num_employees
    FROM company
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p7.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s notice again Zula in line one we see that she is still one of 7 people who started on 01.01.2019. But if we now look at Jennette (line 8) we see that the total number of employees has increased from 7 to 8 (7 persons on 01/01/2019 and 1 person on 02/01/2019). Jennette is therefore one of 8 people who joined the company before or with her.
If we go one line further, it becomes even clearer. Two more people join on 01/03/2019. So far we have had 8 new hires before 01/03/2019, accordingly here the aggregation jumps to 10 (8 previous and 2 for 01/03/2019).</p>
</div>
<div id="multiple-window-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>3.3 Multiple Window Functions</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname, 
       DATENAME(day, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(month, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(year, StartDate) AS Date_Started, 
       COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(StartDate)) As total_num_employees_by_year,
       COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY MONTH(StartDate)) As total_num_employees_by_month
    FROM company
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p8.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s see how we can read this output again: Edna appears in line 1 and is one of 890 people who started working for the company in 2019 and one of 154 who started in <strong>a</strong> January.</p>
<div id="plausibility-check-for-multiple-window-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>3.3.1 Plausibility Check for Multiple Window Functions</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT DATENAME(year, StartDate) AS year,

    GROUP BY DATENAME(year, StartDate)
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p9.png" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT DATENAME(month, StartDate) AS month, 
       COUNT(*) AS num_employees
    FROM company
    GROUP BY DATENAME(month, StartDate)
    ORDER BY CASE DATENAME(month, StartDate)
        WHEN &#39;January&#39; THEN 1
        WHEN &#39;February&#39; THEN 2
        WHEN &#39;March&#39; THEN 3

        WHEN &#39;November&#39; THEN 11

        END
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p10.png" /></p>
<p>From the output shown above with the Window function, we can so far read out how many people started with Edna in 2019 and in a January but not how many people she joined the company together with in January 2019. To get this information we need a <strong>multiple PARTITION BY</strong> statement.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="multiple-partition-by-statements" class="section level2">
<h2>3.4 Multiple PARTITION BY Statements</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname, 
       DATENAME(day, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(month, StartDate) + &#39; &#39; + 
       DATENAME(year, StartDate) AS Date_Started, 
       COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(StartDate)) As total_num_employees_by_year,
       COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY MONTH(StartDate)) As total_num_employees_by_month,

    FROM company
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p11.png" /></p>
<p>Now we have gathered all the information we need. So Edna is one of 890 people who started in 2019, one of 154 who started in a January, and one of 72 who started January 2019.</p>

<p>Does the order of the MULTIPLE PARTITION BY STATEMENTS matter? No not really, the output is just arranged differently.</p>

<h2>3.5 PARTITION BY &amp; ORDER BY Combined</h2>
<div id="with-sum" class="section level3">
<h3>3.5.1 with SUM()</h3>
<p>As already mentioned above, PARTITION BY is the equivalent of ‘group by’ in a window function.
ORDER BY is typically followed a datetime column.</p>
<p>This time we will not use COUNT but SUM as aggregation function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname,
       Department,
       Salary, 
       SUM(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY MONTH(StartDate)) AS sum_salary
    FROM company
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p14.png" /></p>
<p>Now once again with the specification of the respective percentage value:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname,
       Department,
       Salary, 
       SUM(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY MONTH(StartDate)) AS sum_salary,
       ROUND(CAST(Salary AS FLOAT) / SUM(Salary)OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY MONTH(StartDate)) * 100, 2) AS percentage_salary 
    FROM company
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p15.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="with-all-kinds-of-aggregation-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>3.5.2 with all kinds of aggregation functions</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>SELECT Firstname, 
       Lastname,
       Department,
       MONTH(StartDate) AS month,
       Salary, 
       SUM(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY MONTH(StartDate)) AS sum_salary,
       COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY MONTH(StartDate)) AS count_salary,
       AVG(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY MONTH(StartDate)) AS avg_salary,
       MIN(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY MONTH(StartDate)) AS min_salary,
       MAX(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY MONTH(StartDate)) AS max_salary
    FROM company
    ;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-04-12-window-functions_files/p14p16.png" /></p>
<p>So now we have an output with a lot of information about the individual employees.</p>
<p>How to read the information?</p>
<p>We always group by department and order by month. Nancy (line 1) joined department 1 in January with a salary of 100k. The salary number of all employees who went to department 1 in January was 1.15m, the average was 71.875 the lowest salary was 40k and the highest was 105k.</p>
<p>These are only aggregate values for employees who joined Division 1 in a January.</p>
